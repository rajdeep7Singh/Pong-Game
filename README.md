# Pong-Game
This game is the final project in the coursera [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/interactive-python-1/home/welcome) which uses [Codeskulptor](www.codeskulptor.org).This code will work outside codeskulptor also.
Firstly you need to install module SimpleGUICS2Pygame [(Link)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16387770/how-to-integrate-simplegui-with-python-2-7-and-3-0-shell) which is an implementation of simplegui module of codeskulptor.
In some machines you may also need to install pygames [(Link)](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygame) for the above mentioned module.
